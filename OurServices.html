                <h3>Puppy Sitting</h3>
                <p>You love your new puppy with all your heart…but you’re less fond of stained carpets, chewed up shoes,
                    and
                    slobbery clothing. Thankfully, you don’t have to go through the process of transforming your little
                    rascal into a good boy or girl all by yourself. Our local sitters can help you customize the perfect
                    feeding, exercise, and potty schedule for your pup while helping them learn the proper way to behave
                    in
                    your home.</p>

                <h3>Dog Walking</h3>
                <p>Most dogs can’t wait to hear W-A-L-K, but it isn’t always easy to find time for their favorite
                    activity.
                    We can help you give them their daily dose of fun-filled exercise with a 30, 45, or 60-minute walk
                    that
                    includes any feeding, watering, or potty breaks they need.</p>

                <p>Your pet leads a busy life; one you can’t always keep up with. But we’re here to help. Whether it be
                    a
                    nearby vet appointment, trip to the groomers, or playdate at the park, our pet taxi service can make
                    sure your pet safely gets where they need to go.</p>

                <h3>Medical Administration</h3>
                <p>If your pet has a strict schedule for taking prescribed medication, enlisting a little help is never
                    a
                    bad idea. Our medical administrators are experienced with pills, shots, injections, and fluids and
                    can
                    ensure that your pet is getting the right medication at the right time. In their experienced hands,
                    your
                    pet will feel calm and comfortable.</p>
